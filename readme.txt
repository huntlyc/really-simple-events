Simple event module, just a title and start date-time needed!

== Description ==

Simple event module, just a title and start date/time needed!  You can, of course, provide extra information about the event if you wish.  This plugin was created for a bands/performers who do one off shows lasting a couple of hours rather than a few days, so event date ranges, custom post type and so on are not included.

== Installation ==

1. Extract to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Use the shortcode "[hc_rse_events]" or "[hc_rse_events showevents="upcoming|past|all]" in your pages.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When using just [rse_events], what's shown on my page? =

Only upcoming events

= How do I get this plugin translated into my language? =

There's a .po file in the plugin that you can use with a tool like po edit if you wish to translate the plugin into your native languate.  At the moment there's a french translation done via google translate.
